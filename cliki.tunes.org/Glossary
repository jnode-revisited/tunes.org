<p><blockquote>
"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less."
<br>"The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many different things."
<br>"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master-that's all."

<p>Do not hesitate to ask for explanations regarding a word that isn't in this <a class="internal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403183325/http://cliki.tunes.org/Glossary">Glossary</a> yet, or whose current definition you're not satisfied with.

<p>This glossary tries to explain the actual meaning of words related to the world of computers and operating systems, beyond slogans and myths. When multiple meanings exist, it explains which is used in the Tunes project.

<p>This document is also laden with our political and technical opinions (computer-wise), and tries to expose whatever point of view we may have on the described words and concepts. For this reason, partiality and incorrectness may have slipped in it many times. However, we would both like to improve our point of view, and to delimitate it from raw established facts, in as much as such things exist. Hence, please correct any error, inexactitude, confusion, or misguiding style that you find in this document. Also, to add an entry, use the topic "term" for the node.

<p>Please also note that some project members have expressed reservations about some definitions given for some words with political connotations that exceed the computer world.
